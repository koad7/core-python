        "\n",
        "## Course Overview\n",
        "   This introductory chapter gives an overview of the Core Python: Numeric, Types, Dates, and Times course. It covers specialized numeric types such as decimal for precise base-10 calculations, fraction for rational numbers using integral numerators and denominators, and complex type for numbers with an imaginary component. It also covers Python's datetime package for working with dates and times.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Code Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   # No code in this chapter\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "##Â Review of int and float\n",
        "   This chapter reviews Python's basic numeric types: int and float. It discusses the properties of these types that might limit their usefulness in certain scenarios. It also introduces the `sys` module to query the properties of Python's float type.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Code Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   import sys\n",
        "   print(sys.float_info.max)  # prints maximum float value\n",
        "   print(sys.float_info.min)  # prints minimum float value greater than 0\n",
        "   print(float(2**53) == float(2**53 + 1))  # True due to limitations in precision\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Decimal Module\n",
        "   This chapter introduces the `decimal` module, which provides the Decimal type for exact decimal arithmetic. It covers how to create Decimal instances, how to retrieve and modify the context for Decimal computations, and also introduces some special values such as infinity and not a number (NaN).\n",
        "\n",
        "   Code Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   from decimal import Decimal, getcontext\n",
        "\n",
        "   # Create a Decimal instance\n",
        "   print(Decimal(7))  # prints \"7\"\n",
        "\n",
        "   # Get current context\n",
        "   print(getcontext())  # prints current context\n",
        "\n",
        "   # Modify precision\n",
        "   getcontext().prec = 6\n",
        "   print(Decimal('0.1234567') + Decimal('0.0'))  # prints \"0.123457\" due to precision limitation\n",
        "\n",
        "   # Special values\n",
        "   print(Decimal('Infinity'))  # prints \"Infinity\"\n",
        "   print(Decimal('NaN'))  # prints \"NaN\"\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "## Fractional Values, Precision, and Special Values\n",
        "\n",
        "Python's decimal module allows us to handle decimal numbers precisely. It supports the construction of decimal objects using string representations, providing precision preservation. For instance, constructing a decimal object using strings like `Decimal('0.8') - Decimal('0.7')` preserves the precision. However, when passing numbers directly, Python's internal base-2 representation can cause some rounding off, potentially leading to inaccuracies.\n",
        "\n",
        "An example demonstrating the effect of precision in computation:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from decimal import Decimal, getcontext\n",
        "\n",
        "getcontext().prec = 6  # Sets precision to six significant figures\n",
        "x = Decimal('0.1234567')\n",
        "y = Decimal('0.123456')\n",
        "print(x + y)  # Output: Decimal('0.246913')\n",
        "```\n",
        "Here, even though 'x' has seven digits of precision, the result is limited to six digits precision due to the precision setting in the module context.\n",
        "\n",
        "The decimal module also supports special values like infinity (`inf`) and not a number (`NaN`), which propagate through operations as you'd expect.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Combining with Other Types\n",
        "\n",
        "Decimals can safely interact with Python integers but not floats or other numeric types. For instance, arithmetic operations between decimals and floats would raise a TypeError. However, you can compare decimals with floats unless you explicitly disable it. There are some differences in operator behavior; for instance, the modulus operator result sign is taken from the first operand (dividend) in case of decimal types, unlike integers where it's from the divisor. Also, for decimal types, integer division truncates towards zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "Code demonstrating the modulus behavior:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from decimal import Decimal\n",
        "\n",
        "# For integers\n",
        "print((-7) % 3)  # Output: 2\n",
        "\n",
        "# For Decimal\n",
        "print(Decimal('-7') % Decimal('3'))  # Output: Decimal('-1')\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Fractions Module Construction\n",
        "\n",
        "The fractions module provides the Fraction type to represent rational numbers precisely. It stores integral numerators and denominators, and fractions can be created from integers, floats, decimals, or strings. However, constructing fractions from floats with inexact representations might yield unexpected results.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples of fraction construction:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from fractions import Fraction\n",
        "\n",
        "# From integers\n",
        "print(Fraction(2, 3))  # Output: 2/3\n",
        "print(Fraction(4, 5))  # Output: 4/5\n",
        "\n",
        "# From float\n",
        "print(Fraction(0.5))  # Output: 1/2\n",
        "\n",
        "# From decimal\n",
        "from decimal import Decimal\n",
        "print(Fraction(Decimal('0.5')))  # Output: 1/2\n",
        "\n",
        "# From string\n",
        "print(Fraction('2/3'))  # Output: 2/3\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## Arithmetic and Operations\n",
        "\n",
        "Arithmetic operations with fractions work as expected. They support addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, floor division, and modulus. They are compatible with the math module's floor and ceiling functions, which return integers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples of fraction arithmetic:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from fractions import Fraction\n",
        "\n",
        "f1 = Fraction(2, 3)\n",
        "f2 = Fraction(4, 5)\n",
        "\n",
        "# Arithmetic operations\n",
        "print(f1 + f2)  # Output: 22/15\n",
        "print(f1 - f2)  # Output: -2/15\n",
        "print(f1 * f2)  # Output: 8/15\n",
        "print(f1 / f2)  # Output: 5/6\n",
        "```\n",
        "Note: Operations like square roots are not supported because the result may be irrational and can't be represented as a fraction object.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Complex Numbers\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, complex numbers are built-in and represented with a real and imaginary part. The imaginary part is signified by a `j` suffix. Complex numbers can be created directly or via the `complex` constructor which can accept numeric values or a string. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "c1 = 2 + 3j  # create a complex number directly\n",
        "c2 = complex(2, 3)  # create a complex number via the constructor\n",

        "print(c2)  # outputs: (2+3j)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The real and imaginary components of a complex number can be extracted using the `real` and `imag` attributes:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "c = 2 + 3j\n",
        "print(c.real)  # outputs: 2.0\n",
        "print(c.imag)  # outputs: 3.0\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## Operations\n",
        "\n",
        "The `cmath` module provides functions for complex numbers as the regular `math` module functions are incompatible with complex numbers. For instance, the square root of a negative number can be computed using `cmath.sqrt`.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import cmath\n",
        "print(cmath.sqrt(-1))  # outputs: 1j\n",

        "magnitude = abs(c)  # find the magnitude of a complex number\n",
        "phase = cmath.phase(c)  # find the phase of a complex number\n",
        "print(magnitude, phase)  # outputs: 1.4142135623730951 0.7853981633974483\n",

        "## A Practical Example\n",
        "\n",
        "The application of complex numbers in analyzing the phase relationship of voltage and current in AC circuits was discussed. In this example, functions were created to calculate the impedance of inductive, capacitive, and resistive electrical components. The cmath.phase function was used to extract the phase angle.\n",

        "## Built-in Functions Relating to Numbers\n",

        "\n",
        "## Base Conversions\n",
        "\n",
        "Python also provides built-in functions for base conversions. `bin`, `oct`, and `hex` functions convert an integer to binary, octal, and hexadecimal string representations, respectively. The `int` constructor can be used to convert a string to an integer, given the base of the string.\n",
        "\n",
