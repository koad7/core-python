        "# Core Python: Functions and Functional Programming\n",
        "\n",
        "## Course Overview\n",
        "The course \"Core Python: Functions and Functional Programming\" focuses on the important aspect of using functions in Python. It covers key concepts like callables, lambdas, extended forms of Python's formal argument and calling syntax, closures, decorators, functional programming styles, and advanced use of comprehensions.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Function and Callables\n",
        "The first module focuses on understanding callables in Python, which are generalizations of functions and include constructs like classes and lambdas. It reviews the basics of Python functions, including defining free functions and class methods, using positional and keyword arguments, default values, and the importance of Python functions as first-class objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: Simple function definition\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def greet(name):\n",
        "    return f\"Hello, {name}\"\n",
        "\n",
        "print(greet(\"Alice\"))  # Output: Hello, Alice\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## Callable Instances\n",
        "The next section covers Python's special method `__call__`, which enables class instances to be callable just like functions. This is useful in scenarios where you need to maintain some state in a function between calls.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: Callable class instance\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Adder:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, value=0):\n",
        "        self.value = value\n",
        "\n",
        "    def __call__(self, x):\n",
        "        self.value += x\n",
        "        return self.value\n",
        "\n",
        "add = Adder()\n",
        "print(add(5))  # Output: 5\n",
        "print(add(3))  # Output: 8\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## Classes Are Callable\n",
        "Python classes are objects and can be invoked as a callable to construct an instance of the class. The arguments passed when calling a class will be forwarded to the `__init__` method if one exists.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's an example of a class object being called:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class MyClass:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, value):\n",
        "        self.value = value\n",
        "\n",
        "# Instantiate the class\n",
        "instance = MyClass('Hello World')\n",
        "print(instance.value)  # Outputs: Hello World\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the class object `MyClass` is called with the argument `'Hello World'`, which is forwarded to the `__init__` method.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Lambdas\n",
        "Lambdas are anonymous functions, they can be very useful for writing short, simple functions without the need for a def statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's an example of a lambda function:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Sort a list of tuples by the second element using a lambda\n",
        "data = [('one', 1), ('two', 2), ('three', 3)]\n",
        "sorted_data = sorted(data, key=lambda x: x[1])\n",
        "print(sorted_data)  # Outputs: [('one', 1), ('two', 2), ('three', 3)]\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the lambda function takes a single argument `x` and returns the second element of the tuple `x[1]`. This is used as the key to sort the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Summary\n",
        "This chapter reviews Python functions, callable instances, the use of classes as callable objects, defining lambdas, and the differences between lambdas and functions. It introduces the Python's conditional expression and the concept of classes as objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Extended Argument and Call Syntax\n",
        "This chapter explores Python's extended argument syntax for accepting arbitrary numbers of positional arguments and arbitrary keywords.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's an example of a function accepting arbitrary numbers of positional arguments:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def function_with_arbitrary_arguments(*args):\n",
        "    for arg in args:\n",
        "        print(arg)\n",
        "\n",
        "function_with_arbitrary_arguments(1, 2, 3, 4)  # Outputs: 1 2 3 4\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the function `function_with_arbitrary_arguments` can take any number of arguments. The arguments are collected into a tuple `args`, which can be iterated over.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sure, here are the summarized sections with respective code examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "## Keyword and Positional-only Arguments\n",
        "\n",
        "Python function can accept keyword arguments and positional arguments. Keyword arguments can be bundled into a dictionary by prefixing an argument with `**` and positional arguments can be bundled into a tuple by prefixing an argument with `*`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Code example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def html_tag(tag_name, **kwargs):\n",
        "    attributes = ''.join(f' {attr}=\"{value}\"' for attr, value in kwargs.items())\n",
        "    return f\"<{tag_name}{attributes}>\"\n",
        "\n",
        "print(html_tag('img', src=\"sample.png\", alt=\"Sample Image\"))\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "For positional-only arguments, Python uses a `/` in the function's parameter list. All parameters before the `/` are positional-only.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def function(pos_only, /, pos_or_kw, *, kw_only):\n",
        "    print(pos_only, pos_or_kw, kw_only)\n",
        "\n",
        "function(10, 20, kw_only=30)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## Extended Call Syntax\n",
        "\n",
        "Python uses `*` and `**` for unpacking arguments from an iterable or a mapping respectively when calling a function.\n",
        "\n",
        "Code example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def print_args(arg1, arg2, *args):\n",
        "    print(arg1, arg2, args)\n",
        "\n",
        "values = (1, 2, 3, 4)\n",
        "print_args(*values)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "And for dictionary,\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def color(red, green, blue, **kwargs):\n",
        "    print(f\"r={red}, g={green}, b={blue}, extras={kwargs}\")\n",
        "\n",
        "color_values = {'red': 255, 'green': 255, 'blue': 255, 'alpha': 128}\n",
        "color(**color_values)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## Local Functions\n",
        "\n",
        "Python allows you to define functions inside other functions. These are called local functions. Local functions can access the parent function's variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "Code example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def outer_function(x):\n",
        "    def inner_function(y):\n",
        "        return x + y\n",
        "    return inner_function\n",
        "\n",
        "inner = outer_function(10)\n",
        "print(inner(5))  # Prints 15\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## Closures\n",
        "\n",
        "When a nested function references a value in its containing function, Python binds that variable in the context of the nested function. That makes the local function a closure.\n",
        "\n",
        "Code example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def outer_function(x):\n",
        "    def inner_function(y):\n",
        "        return x + y\n",
        "    return inner_function\n",
        "\n",
        "closure = outer_function(10)\n",
        "print(closure(5))  # Prints 15\n",
        "```\n",
        "  \n",
        "  In this example, `inner_function` is a closure that is aware of the variable `x` from its containing function. The variable `x` is stored in `inner_function` even after `outer_function` has finished executing, which is why `closure(5)` is able to return 15.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Closures and Nested Scopes\n",
        "\n",
        "A closure in Python is a function object that has access to variables from its enclosing lexical scope, even when the function is called outside that scope. It occurs when a nested function references a value from its containing function.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def outer_func(x):\n",
        "    def inner_func(y):\n",
        "        return x + y\n",
        "    return inner_func\n",
        "\n",
        "closure = outer_func(10)\n",
        "print(closure(5))  # Outputs: 15\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, `inner_func` forms a closure that includes `x` from its containing function `outer_func`.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can use closures to create function factories where we define behaviors in the outer function that the inner function uses.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def raise_to(exp):\n",
        "    def inner(base):\n",
        "        return base ** exp\n",

        "print(cube(3))  # Outputs: 27\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Nonlocal Keyword\n",
        "\n",
        "The `nonlocal` keyword allows a nested function to assign a new value to a variable defined in the nearest enclosing scope that is not global.\n",
        "\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, the `inner` function modifies the `message` variable in the `outer` function using the `nonlocal` keyword.\n",
        "\n",
        "A practical example with `nonlocal` can be a timer function:\n",
        "\n",
