        "## Course Overview\n",
        "This course introduces byte-oriented programming in Python. It covers bitwise operators, the binary representation of integers, bytes and bytearray types, packing and unpacking binary data with the struct module, memoryview object, and efficiently accessing huge data volumes with memory mapped files. It requires prior knowledge of Python basics, including functions, classes, and modules.\n",

        "## Bit- and Byte-wise Operations\n",
        "This chapter introduces bitwise operators and explains bit and byte-wise operations in Python. Bitwise operations are necessary when dealing with binary data or when interoperating with systems not written in Python. They include bitwise AND, OR, exclusive OR (XOR), bitwise complement (NOT), and shift operators.\n",

        "This chapter introduces the concept of memory-mapped files and how to implement them using the mmap module in Python. The key idea behind memory-mapped files is to use the operating system's virtual memory system to make large files appear as if they're in memory, thereby minimizing the amount of data transferred from disk into memory. The mmap module creates an object that behaves like a byte array and a file-like object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Code Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import mmap\n",
        "\n",
        "with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:\n",
        "    with mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), length=0, access=mmap.ACCESS_READ) as m:\n",
        "        # Use m object as per the requirement\n",
        "        print(m[:10])  # reads the first 10 bytes\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the file 'file.txt' is opened, and a file descriptor is created using the fileno() method. The file descriptor is then passed to the mmap constructor to create a memory-mapped file. The m object can be used similarly to a byte array.\n",
        "\n",
        "The chapter also discusses the importance of properly handling the lifetimes of objects dependent on the memory-mapped file, as these must be shorter than the lifetime of the memory mapping itself. The use of try-finally blocks is recommended to ensure resources are released even in the case of an exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The mmap Module\n",
        "\n",
        "The mmap module provides a way to create, access, and manipulate memory-mapped files. It's an efficient way to read binary data, particularly for very large files. The chapter discusses how the mmap instance supports the C API Bertha protocol and hence can be used as an argument passed to the memory view constructor.\n",
        "\n",
        "This chapter ends with a summary of the entire course, reviewing Python's bitwise operators, binary sequence types (bytes and bytearray), using the struct module to interpret bytes as C language types, and memoryview for obtaining copy-free views. The course concludes by emphasizing the usefulness of memory-mapped files for efficient data handling, encouraging further exploration into more advanced topics like shared memory with mmap and interfacing with native C and C++ code. The material covered in this course is part of the book, \"The Python Master\"."
