        "   This section goes into more depth about classes, attributes, and methods in Python. There's a short introduction to the term \"dunder\" (short for \"double underscore\"), and then an example of a simple class is introduced: ShippingContainer.

This is because `self.next_serial` would refer to an instance attribute, not the class attribute. In case of any confusion, always remember Python's scoping rules and the fact that class blocks or blocks, in general, do not introduce new scopes in Python. Always navigate to class attributes via an object that is available in one of the LEGB scopes.\n",

        "   Static methods in Python allow a function to be associated with a class when the function is conceptually related to the class, but does not require access to the class or instance attributes. They are indicated with a `@staticmethod` decorator and don't need a `self` parameter. Let's look at the `ShippingContainer` example:\n",

        "   Unlike static methods, class methods can access and modify class state. They accept the class object as the first argument, and the common convention is to name this argument `cls`.

        "In Python, `super()` is a built-in function that is used to call a method from the parent class. Method Resolution Order (MRO) is the order in which Python looks for a method in a hierarchy of classes. The `super()` function manipulates this order.

        "\n",
        "In the case of `SortedIntList`, which is a subclass of both `SortedList` and `IntList`, both constraints are maintained. This is because `super()` is used to refer to the MRO of `SortedIntList` in the `.add()` method of both `SortedList` and `IntList`.

        "The next step is to create a `__repr__` method for the class. The decorator checks that the class does not already have a `__repr__` method, and it verifies that the class has its own `__init__` method. It also checks that for every parameter of `__init__`, excluding `self`, there is a corresponding property with the same name.\n",

        "\n",
        "The `@dataclass` decorator automatically adds special methods like `__init__` and `__repr__` to our class. We can also instruct the decorator to generate other special methods by passing optional arguments. For example, to make a class equality comparable, we set `eq=True`.\n",

        "## Hash and Hashability\n",
        "Data classes should ideally be hashable to allow instances to be used in hash-based collections such as sets. Python requires objects to be immutable to be hashable. We can achieve this by only storing immutable data types in the data class and declaring the data class as frozen by setting `frozen=True` in the `@dataclass` decorator.\n",

        "## Dataclass Invariants\n",
        "It's important to establish class invariants to maintain the integrity of our data. One way to enforce invariants in data classes is by using the `__post_init__` method, which is automatically called after the instance has been initialized. We can add checks in this method to validate the attribute values.\n",

        "#### Summary\n",
        "Data classes are a way of creating simple classes in Python that primarily hold data. They're made with the `@dataclass` decorator, and they use type annotations for attribute declaration. By making the class immutable (with `frozen=True`), we ensure that it can be used in hash-based collections. Additionally, we can enforce class invariants by using the `__post_init__` method for validation. If the data class's requirements grow beyond these capabilities, it might be better to use a regular class instead."
